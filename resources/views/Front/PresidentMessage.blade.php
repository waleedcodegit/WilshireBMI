          <p>For the past 8 years, we have had very successful tenures under the leadership of the past Presidents driving the nationals societies to better advocacy and academic achievements. Working together with different national and International societies on different platforms has made SAFES global. </p>
          <p>ISE and ASEAN are working closely with SAFES and the partnership has nurtured to us to greater heights. We can proudly state that South Asian Federation of Endocrine Societies (SAFES) is now an amalgam of a very strong endocrine fraternity in South Asia with bonds extending to East Asia and Africa.
            We are so happy that Afghanistan Endocrine society is now our newest member society which has made our outreach better and has created stronger portfolio in the region. </p>

      <p class="sample-text">SAFES has a clear vision set out to coordinate and enhance advocacy and create platforms for interaction. Advocating the issues that needed much attention like gestational diabetes and better physical health among our children have helped bring awareness among the masses. Even during the  covid-19 lockdown, we have been successful in providing opportunities for training through continuous online CMEs for doctors all across the subcontinent .</p>
      <p class="sample-text"> For the next 2 years under my leadership, SAFES pledges to bring awareness about “Metabesity” among the physicians and the public.Obesity is a global issue now sadly affecting our adolescents and young adults and we need to “Think Thin” and promote better health and nutrition to the across the subcontinent among all ages.  </p>
      <p class="sample-text"> The office of SAFES has now reached Nepal and I look forward to continuous cooperation from all the member Societies of the region to make sure that the flames of SAFES burns bright and paves the road for a great future to fight, prevent and create awareness of endocrine issues. </p>
